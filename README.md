# Unit 14 Sequelize Homework: Reverse Engineering Code

In this homework assignment I reverse engineered the code provided in the develop folder. 
 
 I also created a [google document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ODdVWrhqXV_LI_ZbdHPOoehma9EpOtGA/view?usp=sharing) tutorial for the code. 
  
  Instructions:

  2. Create SQL scripts for 3 databases as named in the config.json file. 

  3. Open and run scripts in MySQL to create the databases.

  5. Open the terminal and run "npm install" to install the required node modules for this project. 

  6. Run npm and fix issues if any. 

  7. Run "node server.js" to check if server is working.
